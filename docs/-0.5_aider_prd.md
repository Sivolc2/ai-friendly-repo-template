The user wants to automate orchestrating multiple Aider agents to implement changes in a code repo. They need a script that can identify the required changes, call a repo PRD generator, and parallelize the process. The script should also summarize the logs and validate that the change is successfully implemented through a set number of iterations. I'll need to design a solution, likely a Python or shell script, to manage this process and integrate with the repo's existing scripts.

---

The user wants to add a new script, "aider\_orchestrator.py," to the repository's "scripts" directory. This would automate generating PRDs, determining parallelism based on file changes, launching multiple Aider agents in parallel, and parsing and summarizing logs. I need to implement the script that works with an existing generator and manage the orchestration of Aider agents. I'll also research Aider's CLI capabilities for automation and logging, preparing instructions and code based on my findings. The response will include both a summary and the code.


---

The user wants to add a new script to the repo to automate the process of managing Aider agents. The script will take in a change specification, generate a PRD, determine how many Aider agents to run in parallel, and orchestrate them to handle tasks. Afterward, it will parse and summarize logs to verify success and failure. I'll need to create an "aider\_orchestrator.py" script and provide both the code and instructions on how it works.

---

Since the user asked for an up-to-date Aider solution, I'll need to provide code. Considering there are existing script examples in the repository, I'll create a Python script named "aider\_orchestrator.py." Before jumping into the code, however, I'm going to gather information on Aider's CLI capabilities for automation, including flags, parallel execution, and log locations. Once I have the details, I can generate the script and present it in accordance with the user's expectations.


---

To implement the user's requested solution, I'll start by creating a Python script called "aider\_orchestrator.py." I'll need to gather information about Aider CLI capabilities, such as flags for automation, parallel execution, and log locations. I plan to use Python’s asyncio for concurrency to run multiple Aider agents in parallel. I also need to parse logs (likely stored in `.aider.chat.log`) for success/failure summaries. Once I gather this info and finalize the approach, I’ll build and document the solution.

---

Before diving into the code, I need to proceed with a bit of research on Aider's CLI features, such as scripting capabilities, available flags for automation, and log file locations. I'll gather at least 10 references from reliable sources, so I can include accurate info and citations. Once I have this, I’ll design an orchestrator script that runs Aider agents concurrently using Python's asyncio. The script will auto-generate the PRD using the gemini\_prd\_generator.py script and include features like parsing CLI arguments. I'll also need to ensure the script fits well within the repository structure.


---

The `gemini_prd_generator` isn't currently exposing a function directly, so it seems better to call it via subprocess within the orchestrator. I'll use Python's subprocess to run `gemini_prd_generator` and parse the output path. We can also determine the number of agents either by counting the impacted files (via "git diff --name-only") or using a simpler heuristic based on concurrency and the number of files. I'll start each Aider session as a subprocess and log the output for later parsing.

---

The orchestrator should use Python’s subprocess to run `gemini_prd_generator` and then parse its output path.

To determine the number of agents, we could either inspect the files affected or use a simpler heuristic—such as allowing each agent to handle up to N files. After generating the PRD, the model can parse acceptance criteria based on changed lines.

I'll kick off multiple Aider sessions, passing each task to separate agents, and then summarize the JSONL logs to count iterations, focusing on lines with "assistant\_response".


Thought for 55 seconds


Below is a drop‑in **multi‑agent orchestration workflow** that snaps into your existing `repo_src/scripts/` toolbelt.

## What the new `aider_orchestrator.py` does

1. **Generates a fresh PRD** for the requested change by piping the prompt through your `gemini_prd_generator.py`.
2. **Heuristically fans‑out work** across *N* Aider sessions (defaults to your CPU‑core count; override with `--max-agents`).
3. **Runs each agent non‑interactively** via `aider --yes --message …` so they churn through edits without stopping for Y/N prompts ([Aider][1], [Aider][2]).
4. **Captures a structured JSONL log** from every session with Aider’s `--analytics-log` switch ([Aider][3]).
5. **Post‑processes the logs** to count “assistant\_response” events (≈ iterations) and writes a single summary JSON you can diff or feed back into your supervisor agent.

> **Path added:** `repo_src/scripts/aider_orchestrator.py` (see canvas for the full, commented source).

### Key design choices & how to tweak them

| Concern               | Implementation detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | How to adjust                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task splitting**    | `--files` option lets you hand‑pick targets; otherwise the script gives every agent the full repo context (safe default while you prototype). Hook in a smarter splitter (e.g., parse `git diff –name-only` or the repo‑map JSON) inside `_split_seq`. | Edit `_generate_prd` to parse the PRD and assign sub‑features; or wire a quick call to Aider’s own `/show-repo-map` output ([Aider][4]).                                  |
| **Parallelism**       | Uses `asyncio` to launch each Aider CLI in its own subprocess; IO‑bound, so concurrency scales until you saturate API rate limits.                                                                                                                     | Cap with `--max-agents`; add exponential back‑off or a semaphore if you hit provider throttling.                                                                          |
| **Model selection**   | The wrapper exposes `--model` for Aider (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-opus`) and `--gemini-model` for the PRD step.                                                                                                                                       | Extend CLI flags as needed; the script passes them straight through.                                                                                                      |
| **Iteration metrics** | Counts JSON events where `"event":"assistant_response"`—simple, but good enough to flag runaway loops.                                                                                                                                                 | Swap `_summarize` with richer analytics: diff LOC touched, wall‑clock duration, cost per token, etc.; all present in the analytics log format ([GitHub][5], [GitHub][6]). |

## How it plugs into your repo workflow

```bash
# 1 — Propose a change ✏️
CHANGE="Add user‑password reset flow with email OTP"

# 2 — Fire off the orchestrator 🚀
python repo_src/scripts/aider_orchestrator.py \
       --change "$CHANGE" \
       --max-agents 4 \
       --model gpt-4o \
       --gemini-model gemini-1.5-pro
```

* The generated PRD drops into `docs/prd/`, keeping versioned specs next to code (matches your `feature_flow.md`).
* Each Aider session works in `.aider_logs/agent<N>_*.jsonl`; the merged summary is timestamped alongside them.
* Commit the PRD and summary into your branch for easy code‑review context.

### Optional niceties you can add next

* **Fail‑fast health‑check:** parse each agent’s return‑code and abort the pipeline (or reroute to a rollback branch) when one goes non‑zero.
* **Supervisor/Reviewer pass:** spawn one extra agent in *read‑only* mode (`--readonly`) to critique the diffs from the first wave—mirroring the multi‑agent idea in Aider’s community discussion ([GitHub][7]).
* **Branch isolation:** run each agent in a temporary feature branch (`git switch -c agent‑<n>`) so merges remain conflict‑free; Aider respects Git state automatically ([Aider][2]).
* **Sub‑tree focus:** if you’re on a big monorepo, launch agents from the relevant sub‑directory with `--subtree-only` or `--aiderignore` patterns to keep token counts tight ([Aider][4]).
* **Dashboard:** feed the summary JSON to a small Streamlit or Next.js dashboard that shows iteration counts, PRD link, cost, and a “merge PR” button.
