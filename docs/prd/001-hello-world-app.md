# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application.  This application will serve as a foundational example for demonstrating basic functionality and deployment within our system.  The application will have a frontend component displaying the message and a backend component (optional, can be skipped for a purely frontend solution).

**2. Goals**

* Create a functional "Hello, World!" application.
* Demonstrate the integration between frontend and backend (if implemented).
* Provide a clear, concise example for future development.
* Establish a baseline for testing and CI/CD pipelines.

**3. User Stories (Optional, as this is a simple example)**

* As a developer, I want a simple "Hello, World!" application to ensure basic functionality.
* As a tester, I want a simple application to verify testing and CI/CD processes.

**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

**4.1 Frontend Development:**

This section focuses on creating a simple user interface that displays the "Hello, World!" message.  The technology choice will depend on the existing frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.). The frontend should be easily testable.

**4.2 Backend Development (Optional):**

This section outlines the development of a backend component (if chosen).  This might involve a simple API endpoint that returns the "Hello, World!" message.  This section should include details on the technology stack (Python/Flask, Node.js, etc.) and API design. This section can be skipped if we opt for a purely frontend solution.

**4.3 Testing:**

Unit and integration tests will verify the functionality of both frontend and (if applicable) backend components.  This should include tests for proper message display and API response (if applicable).  The testing framework should be consistent with the rest of the project.

**4.4 Deployment:**

This section outlines the process of deploying the application.  This may involve publishing the frontend to a hosting service and deploying the backend to a server (if applicable). Details on the chosen deployment process and any required infrastructure should be included.


**5. Non-Goals**

* Complex features beyond displaying "Hello, World!"
* Database integration
* User authentication
* Advanced styling or UI elements
