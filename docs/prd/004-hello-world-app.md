# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application.  This application will serve as a baseline for future development and testing within the project. The application should be easily deployable and demonstrable, showcasing basic functionality.  The target audience is developers and testers within the project.

**2. Goals**

* Create a functional "Hello, World!" application.
* Demonstrate a basic project setup and deployment workflow.
* Establish a foundation for future feature additions.
* Provide a simple, easily understandable example for new team members.

**3. User Stories**

* As a developer, I want a simple application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console so I can verify basic functionality.
* As a tester, I want a straightforward application to ensure the testing framework is correctly set up.


**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

**4.1. Application Logic:**

The application will consist of a single function that prints the string "Hello, World!" to the standard output (console). This function will be called when the application starts.  Error handling should be minimal for this initial version.

**4.2. Deployment:**

The application will be packaged and deployed as an executable or script, depending on the chosen technology. The deployment process will be documented in a separate guide.

**4.3. Testing:**

Unit tests will verify that the application prints the correct string to the console.  Integration testing will focus on successful deployment and execution.

**5. Non-Goals**

* This application will not include any user input or interaction beyond console output.
* This application will not utilize external libraries or dependencies beyond those strictly necessary for printing to the console (if any).
* This application will not have advanced error handling or exception management at this stage.  Simplicity is prioritized.
