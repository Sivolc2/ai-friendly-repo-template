## PRD Naming Convention

PRDs should be named using the following format:

```
NNN-feature-name.md
```

Where:
- `NNN` is a three-digit number that increases sequentially (e.g., 001, 002, etc.)
- `feature-name` is a kebab-case name of the feature

## Design Differences

- PRDs focus on user needs and acceptance criteria rather than implementation details
- Each PRD should be self-contained and focused on a single feature
- PRDs should be living documents that evolve as the feature is implemented
