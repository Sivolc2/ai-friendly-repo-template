# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application. This application will serve as a foundational example for future development and demonstrate basic functionality within the system.  The simplicity of this application allows for a clear demonstration of the development process using Aider agents.

**2. Goals**

* Create a functional "Hello, World!" application that displays the text "Hello, World!" to the user.
* Demonstrate a successful end-to-end workflow using Aider agents for development.
* Establish a baseline for future, more complex projects.

**3. User Stories**

As a developer, I want to see a "Hello, World!" application so I can verify the basic functionality of the Aider system.

**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

**4.1 Frontend:**

The frontend will consist of a single component responsible for displaying "Hello, World!" on the screen.  This can be a simple HTML element or a component in a framework like React.

**4.2 Backend (Optional):**

For this initial project, a backend is not strictly necessary. However, a basic backend could be implemented to return the "Hello, World!" message as an API endpoint, providing a foundation for future, backend-required features.

**5. Non-Goals**

* Complex user interaction or features.
* Database integration.
* Extensive error handling or sophisticated user interface design.
* Deployment to a production environment.

**6. Success Criteria**

The application is considered successful if it displays "Hello, World!" to the user upon execution and the entire development process is documented and reproducible via the Aider agents' interaction logs and generated code.
