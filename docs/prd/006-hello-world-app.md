# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application.  This application will serve as a foundational example for future development and testing within the system.  The application will display the text "Hello, World!" to the user.  The target platform is unspecified at this time, allowing flexibility for future implementation choices.

**2. Goals**

* Create a functioning "Hello, World!" application.
* Demonstrate the basic workflow of the AIDER system for developing and deploying simple applications.
* Provide a template for more complex future projects.
* Establish a foundational codebase that can be readily extended.

**3. User Stories**

As a developer, I want a simple "Hello, World!" application so I can verify my system's functionality.
As a tester, I want to easily run the application to confirm it displays the expected output.

**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

* **4.1  Application Selection:**  Determine an appropriate technology stack (e.g., Python, Javascript, C++). Justification for the chosen technology should be documented.
* **4.2  Core Functionality:** Implement the core functionality: display "Hello, World!" This might involve creating a single file with the relevant code or using a more elaborate framework (depending on the selected technology).
* **4.3  Output Method:** Determine the method to display the output.  This could be to the console, browser, GUI, etc.
* **4.4  Deployment (Optional):** Outline the steps necessary to deploy the application based on the chosen environment (This section can be omitted if just core functionality is completed).
* **4.5  Testing:** Describe the testing strategy. At a minimum, testing should confirm that "Hello, World!" is displayed correctly.


**5. Non-Goals**

* This project will not include advanced features such as user input, persistent storage, or complex UI elements.
* This project will not focus on optimizing for performance or scalability.
