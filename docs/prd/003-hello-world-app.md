# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application.  This application will serve as a foundational example for future development and testing within the project. The application will display the text "Hello, World!" to the user.  This seemingly trivial application will allow us to establish a streamlined development workflow and testing procedure.


**2. Goals**

* Create a functional "Hello, World!" application.
* Establish a baseline for future feature development and testing.
* Demonstrate a successful end-to-end workflow from PRD creation to deployment.
* Validate the Aider agent workflow for code generation and testing.


**3. User Stories**

* As a developer, I want a simple application that displays "Hello, World!" so that I can verify the basic functionality of the development environment.
* As a tester, I want to be able to easily run tests to ensure the application works as expected, to build confidence in our CI/CD pipeline.


**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

* **4.1 Frontend Development:**  This section will focus on creating a user interface (UI) that displays "Hello, World!".  This might involve creating a simple HTML file, or potentially using a framework depending on existing project scaffolding. The output should be easily testable.

* **4.2 Backend Development:** (Optional, depending on architecture). If a backend is required, this section will outline implementation of any necessary server-side logic. This is unlikely for a simple "Hello, World!" application but is included for completeness.

* **4.3 Testing:**  This section details the unit and integration tests to verify the application's functionality. The tests should cover different scenarios to ensure the application works correctly.  For example, testing for proper string output, handling of errors (if any exist), and performance under basic load.

* **4.4 Deployment:**  This section will outline the steps required to deploy the application. This could be as simple as copying the files to a web server or using a more sophisticated deployment pipeline depending on project setup.


**5. Non-Goals**

* This application will not include any advanced features or complex interactions.  The focus is on simplicity and establishing a baseline.
* Error handling beyond basic functionality is outside the scope of this project.
* No user authentication or authorization will be implemented.
