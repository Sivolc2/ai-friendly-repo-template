# Product Requirements Document: Hello World Application

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a simple "Hello, World!" application.  This application will serve as a foundational example for future development and testing within our system.  The application will accept no input and consistently output the string "Hello, World!".

**2. Goals**

* Create a functional "Hello, World!" application.
* Demonstrate the ability to generate and deploy a simple application using our AI-assisted development pipeline.
* Establish a baseline for future feature development and testing.


**3. User Stories (Not Applicable)**

This is a foundational example with no direct user interaction.  Therefore, user stories are not applicable.

**4. Detailed Technical Plan**

The application will be implemented as a simple script.  This script will be executed via the command-line interface (CLI), and can be expanded upon in future iterations. There are two primary distinct sections:

**4.1 Section: Script Development**

* **Task:** Write a script (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.) that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
* **Sub-Tasks:**
    * Choose an appropriate scripting language based on existing project infrastructure.
    * Write the core script function to print the message.
    * Implement any necessary error handling (though minimal in this case).
    * Ensure the script can be easily executed from the command line.
* **Deliverables:** The completed script file, ready to be executed.

**4.2 Section: Deployment and Execution Test**

* **Task:** Create a deployment and testing mechanism to run the 'hello world' script and assert successful execution.
* **Sub-Tasks:**
    * Define a simple method for running the completed script. This could be a shell command, integration into a test suite, or simple invocation of the appropriate runner.
    * Implement an assertion mechanism to verify the script produces the correct output.
    * Document the steps for anyone to repeat the deployment and testing process.
* **Deliverables:** Deployment instructions, test script and the test results.

**5. Non-Goals**

* This application will not include any user interaction or input processing.
* This application will not incorporate any external libraries or dependencies beyond those strictly necessary for script execution and output.
* This application will not persist data or interact with any external services.
